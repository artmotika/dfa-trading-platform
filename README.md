## 🚀 Why Pellu?

Pellu is designed for high-concurrency environments where performance and regulatory compliance are non-negotiable.

- **Extreme Scalability**: Powered by **Java 21 Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**, handling thousands of concurrent connections with minimal overhead.
- **Stateless Architecture**: Zero-DB Gateway validation using enriched JWT claims and a **Redis-backed Global State Cache**.
- **Hybrid DEX Model**: Off-chain matching for sub-millisecond response times + On-chain settlement (Anchor/Solana) for immutable transparency.
- **Built-in Compliance**: Automated KYC/AML enforcement, investor limits (Retail/Qualified), and account freezing logic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.2, Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Distributed State**: Redis 7 (Hash-based state storage)
- **Messaging**: Apache Kafka (Event-driven inter-service communication)
- **Blockchain**: Rust, Anchor Framework (Solana Program)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15, Liquibase
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes (K8s Manifests included)
- **Testing**: Locust (Load Testing), Python (Functional Master Suite)

## 🏗️ Microservices Overview

1.  **API Gateway**: The entry point. Performs **stateless JWT validation** and serves high-speed market data from the Redis cache.
2.  **Auth Service**: Manages user lifecycles, KYC status, and identity. Optimized with BCrypt and distributed token management.
3.  **Trading Engine**: The heart of the platform. Features an **in-memory matching engine**, processes IPOs, and maintains the order book.
4.  **Solana Connector**: The bridge between Web2 and Web3. Listens to Kafka events to trigger on-chain transactions and settlement.

## 💎 Key Features

### ⚖️ Regulatory Compliance
*   **KYC/AML Flow**: Integrated moderations. Only `APPROVED` users can trade.
*   **Account Controls**: Instantly freeze suspicious accounts or perform administrative clawbacks.
*   **Investor Limits**: Hard limits on annual investments for retail investors (600,000 RUB) to meet local regulations.

### 📈 Trading & Market
*   **Asset Lifecycle**: Managed IPOs (Planned -> Active -> Finalized) and secondary market trading.
*   **Order Matching**: High-speed matching of BUY/SELL orders by price and asset.
*   **Real-time State**: Redis mirrors the database state for ultra-low latency GET requests.

### 🗳️ Corporate Actions
*   **On-chain Voting**: Token-weighted governance. Vote weight corresponds to the holder's balance.
*   **Dividends**: Trigger automated dividend payouts to all token holders via a single administrative action.

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Pellu has been rigorously verified under extreme load:
*   **Throughput**: ~1,000+ requests per second.
*   **Latency**: Order placement average **9ms** (P99 at 31ms).
*   **Stability**: **100% Success Rate** (0 failures) during a 1,000-user concurrent stress test.
